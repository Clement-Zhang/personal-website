                    Hello there! I'm Clement Zhang, a Computer Science student at Toronto Metropolitan University 
                    (formerly Ryerson University). I'm interested in software engineering and web development. 
                    I'm currently looking for a 2024 summer internship. I made this website to showcase my skills in 
                    React. In the future, I will improve the pages and add more content.
                </p>
            </Default>
        </div>
    );
